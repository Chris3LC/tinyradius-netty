/**
 * Interfaces and classes that manage
 * a dictionary of Radius attribute types.
 * <p>
 * Each attribute type is represented by an instance of the
 * object <code>AttributeType</code>. This class stores the
 * type code, the type name and the vendor ID for each
 * attribute type.
 * <p>
 * Dictionaries that can be changed after construction should
 * implement the interface <code>WritableDictionary</code>.
 * You can use the class <code>DictionaryParser</code>
 * to populate <code>WritableDictionary</code> objects with
 * data from a dictionary file in the well-known Radiator
 * dictionary file format.
 * <p>
 * <code>MemoryDictionary</code> is the default implementation
 * of <code>WritableDictionary</code>. It manages a dictionary held
 * in the RAM. This class is used together with the
 * <code>DictionaryParser</code> by the class {@link org.tinyradius.dictionary.DefaultDictionary}
 * which is a singleton object containing the default dictionary
 * that is used if there is no dictionary explicitly specified.
