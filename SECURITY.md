# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only latest version is supported. Note that the project does not follow semver, but effort is made to minimize API /
package changes within a patch version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Preference is to [open an issue](https://github.com/globalreachtech/tinyradius-netty/issues) to track changes and requirements - avoid direct messages as they cannot be tracked and are dependent on a maintainer's bandwidth.

Security issues are prioritised below RFC MUST/REQUIRED/SHALL compliance bugs, but above SHOULD/RECOMMENDED.
