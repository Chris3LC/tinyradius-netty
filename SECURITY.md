# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only latest version is supported. Note that the project does not yet follow semver.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Preference is to [open an issue](https://github.com/globalreachtech/tinyradius-netty/issues) - avoid direct messages as they cannot be tracked and are dependent on a maintainer's bandwidth.

Security issues are prioritised below RFC MUST/REQUIRED/SHALL compliance bugs, but above SHOULD/RECOMMENDED.
