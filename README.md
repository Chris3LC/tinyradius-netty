TinyRadius-Netty is a fork of the TinyRadius Radius library, rebuilt with Java 8 and Netty patterns/features.

## Features
- Sends/receives Radius packets
- Signs and verifies Request Authenticator for Access and Accounting requests/responses
- Supports verifying and encoding for PAP, CHAP, and EAP (Message-Authenticator)
- Attach arbitrary attributes to packets
- Loads dictionaries recursively from file system or classpath (Radiator format)

### Improvements over TinyRadius
- Netty for async IO, timeouts, thread management
- Handlers follow Netty's interceptor filter pattern, blocking calls use promises
- log4j2 instead of commons-logging
- Java 6-8 features (generics, NIO, lambdas, streams)
- Packets and Attributes are (shallow) immutable
- 80%+ test coverage
- Proxy no longer a separate implementation, but a promise-based adapter between the client and server classes

## Usage
See the [example implementations](src/test/java/org/tinyradius) on usage as Client/Server/Proxy.

### Dictionary
 - `DefaultDictionary` uses a very limited subset that's included in the classpath.
   - Singleton is available at `DefaultDictionary.INSTANCE`
 - `DictionaryParser` parses custom resources and takes a `ResourceResolver` parameter.
   - Factory methods `newFileParser()` and `newClasspathParser()` resolves resources on file system and classpath respectively. Dictionaries can include other files to parse, and paths are resolved differently in each case.
 - Results of dictionary parses are stored as `AttributeType`.

### Attribute
 - `RadiusAttribute` is used for octets attributes and attributes without a dictionary entry or specific subtype.
   - Attribute subtypes such as `IntegerAttribute` store the same data, but have convenience methods for maniupulation and stricter data validation.
 - `AttributeType` contains the attribute type, name, data type, and enumeration of valid values if appropriate.
   - A `create()` method is used to create attributes directly for that type.
   - If only the attribute type ID is known, rather than the AttributeType object, use `Attributes.create()` which will create a basic `RadiusAttribute`. This is safer as it will always successfully create an attribute even if there's no dictionary entry for the type ID.
 - `VendorSpecificAttribute` stores lists of vendor-specific attributes instead of attribute data itself, and serializes its data by concatenating byte array representations of sub-attributes with its type/vendorId/length header.

### Packet
 - `RadiusPacket` represents packet and associated data, with `RadiusRequest` and `RadiusResponse` as main concrete classes.
   - `encodeRequest()` and `encodeResponse()` return a new copy of the current RadiusPacket with the Authenticator
   - `AccessRequest` and `AccessResponse` has a different way of encoding/verifying the packet authenticator compared to other Radius request/response types and encodes the appropriate password/Message-Authenticator attributes.
 - `RadiusPackets` contains utils for creating packets and using a more specific subclass where possible, and for generating a valid packet identifier.
 - `PacketType` contains list of constants of packet types. It's intentionally not an enum to allow for types that aren't included in the list / added in the future.
 - `PacketEncoder` contains methods for converting to/from netty Datagram and ByteBufs.

### Client
 - `RadiusClient` manages setting up sockets and netty, and the plumbing for the `communicate()` method to return a `Future<RadiusPacket>`
 - `TimeoutHandler` contains a method which is called after every request is sent, with a Runnable to retry. The retry runnable is then scheduled or timeout triggered depending on the implementation.
 - `PromiseAdapter` is a ChannelHandler that requires a promise to be passed in with the outbound request in a `PendingRequestCtx` wrapper.
   - The Promise passed into the handler is incomplete. The Promise is completed and removed from memory when a valid response is received or timeouts.
   - Appends a `Proxy-State` attribute to the packet and uses that to match request/responses.

### Server
  - `RadiusServer` sets up netty listeners and sockets.
  - Packets should go through `ServerPacketCodec` first to verify shared secrets and convert between Datagram and `RequestCtx` (a wrapper around `RadiusPacket`), and `ResponseCtx` for responses.
    - `BasicCachingHandler` should be used before the actual handler if required. It provides hooks to override for hit/miss events.
    - `RequestHandler` handles `RequestCtx`, but only accepts specific subtypes of `RadiusRequest`.
    - `ProxyHandler` handles incoming requests and proxies the request using an instance of RadiusClient.
